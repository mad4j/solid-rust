# Introduction

In object-oriented programming, the **SOLID** design principles are a set of five guidelines that help developers create software that is **scalable, maintainable, and flexible**. Introduced by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)**, these principles aim to reduce dependencies and make code easier to understand and modify.

The acronym **SOLID** stands for:  

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP) – A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.  
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP) – Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP) – Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.  
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP) – Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.  
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.  

By following these principles, developers can create software that is easier to test, extend, and maintain while reducing the risk of introducing bugs when making changes. SOLID principles are fundamental to designing robust and flexible software architectures.
